## TEND_Descriptive_Data
##### This repo will contain a variety of different Rmd files. This is a change of approach, because in the past I had created singular, large Rmd files that contained specialized code chunks within. In order to have a more optimized collection of notes, I want to make it easier to navigateb through my Github. I will try having separate Rmd files for as many specialized tasks as possible in this repo. We will be discussing the most common methods of exploring your data set (possibly cleaning) to describe it in such a way that you couldn't visualize or understand before. While a lot of this code doesn't end up on your final draft of a project, it is the code that gets you there.
